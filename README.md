# SUM COMBINATION CALCULATOR

Simply use the built in black jack to calculate possible sums or enter a custom list of integers and a legal sum of two elements, the program will randomly count all possible combinations.

*Example: 

input [0] to create a custom list or [1] to use a 52 elements black jack deck: 0
enter number of elements in your list: 3
input elements:
1
2
3
deck length: 3
[1, 2, 3]
enter sum: 3
Count: 1

--> there is only one pair whose sum is 3, so the output is ,,Count: 1''

*order of elements doesnt matter, (a, b) & (b, a) do only count as one combination.
